<span style="border: 1px solid black ;">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</span> is the main markup language for creating web pages and others <br> information that can be displayed in web browser. <br><br>

HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags inclosed in angel brackets (like < html >). within the web page content. HTML  tags most commonly come in pairs like < h1 > and </ h1 >, Although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for the example < img >. The first tag in a pair is start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags). In between these tags web designers can add text, further tags , comments and other types of text based content.
